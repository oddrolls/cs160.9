TIME COMPLEXITY: 
MINMAXSUM: The time complexity of Mini-Max Sum is O(nlogn) because though there is a single for loop in the code, there is also Collections.sort of the array which runs in logn time.
Therefore, O(n) * O(logn) = O(nlogn).

WEIGHTED UNIFORM STRINGS: The time complexity of Weighted Uniform Strings is O(n^2), because that is the largest time complexity in the function. There are plenty of for loops, but
only one set of nested for loops. The complexity of HashMap creation is constant. 

SPACE COMPLEXITY: 
MINMAXSUM: The space complexity of Mini-Max Sum is O(1) because we are making alterations on the array that is already given to us as opposed to creating a new array from scratch.
If we were creating a new array, it would be O(n). But we're not :)

WEIGHTED UNIFORM STRINGS: The space complexity of this function is O(n) because we use extra space in the HashMap. Since the space in the HashMap is dependent on the input n, 
the space complexity is O(n).
